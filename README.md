# GSL_Data_Visualization
Great Salt Lake water level data visualization project.

The current purpose of this project is to plot and represent the change in water level of the Great Salt Lake over time.

Other ideas to potentially implement into this project:

- Dust risk analysis. Using soil data, wind patterns, and exposed lake bed imagery to model the potential risk of hazardous dust emissions.
- Salinity Analysis. The level of the salinity and how it might affect the surround ecosystem.

Further down the line I would like to incorporate this data into an interactive website. The website would essentially have a polygon of the Great Salt Lake and using a slider or datetime entry the polygon area would change based on the water levels of that time. This would be a great way to visualize the recession of Great Salt Lake. It seems USGS data for GSL is updated every 15 minutes, perhaps the site could also display other relevant statistics live on the website.
